    <h1>Richard Kaufman is a software engineer</h1>

    <p>Currently, I’m doing freelance full-stack web development.</p>

    <p>Previously, I built tools that analyzed content sharing at <a href="https://twitter.com/pictoline">Pictoline</a>, a visual news & information media company.</p>

    <p>In 2014 and 2015 I was the creative technologist at <a href="http://flock.mx">Flock</a>, a digital advertising company. At Flock I also was the director of the Maker Lab, a rapid prototyping laboratory that worked closely with creative directors to turn ideas into prototypes ready to communicate ideas.</p>

    <p>I build websites using Javascript, Node.js, React.js, Koa, and NoSQL databases.</p>

    <p>I create interactive applications and data visualizations using Processing.</p>

    <p>I invent objects for the Internet of Things using Arduino and electronics.</p>

    <p>I'm obsessed with building communities. I co-organize <a href="http://www.meetup.com/javascriptmx/">Mexico's Javascript community</a> with my friends, Latin America's largest programming meetup. Back in the day, I co-founded Students for Free Culture @ UPRM. I gather with my friends to hack technology and make art at the Laboratorio del Error Diseñado (Lab for Erroneus Design.)</p>

    <p>If you'd like to talk to me, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:richardbkaufman@gmail.com">email</a> or to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/sparragus">Twitter</a>.</p>
